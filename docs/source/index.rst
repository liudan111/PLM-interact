Welcome to PLM-interact's documentation!
===================================
**PLM-interact** is a Python library for PPI prediction and mutant effects prediction.

Protein structure can now be predicted from amino acid sequences with unprecedented accuracy, yet the prediction of proteinâ€“protein interactions remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate that protein language models originally designed for single proteins can be extended to jointly encode interacting protein pairs. Our model, PLM-Interact, achieves state-of-the-art performance on both within-species and cross-species PPI prediction benchmarks and can also be fine-tuned to predict mutation effects in human PPIs.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section and :doc:`installation` section for how to install and use this tool for PPI prediction.
