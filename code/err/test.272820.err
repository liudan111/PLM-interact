Some weights of EsmForMaskedLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /mnt/data/project0019/danliu/PPI/offline/esm2_t12_35M_UR50D and are newly initialized: ['lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
